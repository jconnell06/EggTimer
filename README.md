# Egg Timer
This app was created as a part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WsWAEMScldUQn8F/) I am taking (April 2020). 

The goal was to create an app in which the user could select a desired type of boiled egg (Soft, Medium, or Hard), and an automatic timer would start with the ideal cook time. 

I added a "Stop" button which would allow the user to stop the timer (perhaps the user decided they wanted a soft-boiled egg instead of a hard-boiled egg).

## Lesson Objectives
